# Tripleten Music

A React-based music application that integrates with the Spotify API to provide music search and playback functionality.

## Environment Setup

This project requires Spotify API credentials to function properly. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

### 1. Create a `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

```env
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here
VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:5173/callback
```

### 2. Get Spotify API Credentials

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Log in with your Spotify account
3. Create a new application
4. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret
5. In your Spotify app settings, add `http://127.0.0.1:5173/callback` to the Redirect URIs
6. Replace the placeholder values in your `.env` file

### 3. Security Notes

- The `.env` file is already added to `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive data
- Never commit your actual API credentials to version control
- For production deployment, set these environment variables in your hosting platform

## Development

This project uses Vite for fast development and building. The main plugins are:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh

- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

Successfully Implemented Spotify OAuth Authentication

Key Features Working:

âœ… User Login Flow - Users can click "INICIAR SESIÃ“N" and get redirected to Spotify's authorization page
âœ… OAuth Callback Handling - After authorization, users are redirected back to the app
âœ… Authentication State Management - The app properly stores and manages access tokens and user info
âœ… Protected Routes - Users are redirected to the Player page when authenticated
âœ… Logout Functionality - Users can sign out and return to the home page
âœ… Conditional UI - The NavBar shows different content based on authentication status
âœ… Song Card Behavior - Clicking songs takes authenticated users directly to Player, unauthenticated users see the login modal

Technical Fixes Applied:

Fixed State Parameter Issue - Modified clearInvalidAuth() to not clear the OAuth state parameter during authentication flow
Environment Variables - Moved Spotify credentials to .env file for security
Error Handling - Implemented proper error handling for authentication failures
Route Protection - Added authentication checks to protect the Player page
UI State Management - Properly managed authentication state across components
User Flow:
Unauthenticated User â†’ Clicks song â†’ LoginModal appears â†’ Clicks "Iniciar sesiÃ³n con Spotify" â†’ Redirected to Spotify â†’ Authorizes â†’ Redirected back to Player page
Authenticated User â†’ Clicks song â†’ Directly taken to Player page
Logout â†’ User signs out â†’ Returns to home page â†’ Can log in again
The authentication system is now fully functional and ready for production use! ðŸš€
